# Meta-Analysis of Randomized Experiments with Jackknife Instrumental Variables

## Overview

This package provides tools for meta-analysis of many randomized experiments (also known as A/B tests) in an instrumental variables framework.  Specifically to address the problem of many weak instruments, we implement Jackknife Instrumental Variables Estimation (JIVE).
